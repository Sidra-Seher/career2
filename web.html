    <h1><u>WEB DEVELOPMENT</u></h1>
    <p>
        <b>Web development</b> is the work involved in <b><u>developing a website</u></b> for the <b>Internet</b> (World Wide Web) or an <b>intranet</b> (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a <u><b>simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications</b></u>, <b>electronic businesses</b>, and <b>social network services</b>. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include <b>Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration</b>, and <b>e-commerce development</b>.   
    </p>
    <h2><u><b>Tools used in WEB</b></u></h2>
    <p> 1)<b>Wix</b> (The best web design software for beginners.<br>
        2)<b>Adobe Dreamweaver</b>. (The best web design software for professionals.)<br>
        3)<b>WordPress</b> (The best custom option for beginners.)<br> 
        4)<b>Weebly </b>(The DIY e-commerce website.)<br>
        5)<b>Webflow</b> (Cloud-based offering that needs no coding knowledge.)<br>
        6)<b>Bluefish</b> (Lightweight and easy to use web coding platform.)<br>
        7)<b>Visual Studio Code</b>  (A text editor from Microsoft.)<br>
    </p>
    <h2><u><b>Languages in WEB</b></u></h2>
    <p>
        1)<b>JAVASCRIPT</b><br>
        2)<b>PYTHON</b><br>
        3)<b>TYPESCRIPT</b><br>
        4)<b>PHP</b><br>
        5)<b>RUBY</b><br>
        6)<b>HTML & CSS</b><br>
    </p>
    <h2><u><b>JAVASCRIPT</b></u></h2>
    <p>There is no doubt that <b>JavaScript</b> is the <u>King of web development</u> and probably the <u>most popular language</u> among web developers. It’s also the only language that allows you to <b> web applications</b>, both <b>frontend</b>, and <b>backend</b> as well as <b> applications</b> (React Native).
        The <b>strength of Javascript</b> is not just it can <u>run on browser and server</u> using Nodejs but also the <u>awesome frameworks and libraries</u> it has for web development and app development.
        For example, you can use <b>React.js</b> and <b>Angular for frontend</b>, <b>Nodejs for backend</b>, and <b>React Native for creating cross-platform</b> (both Android and iOS) mobile apps.</p>
        <h2><u><b>PYTHON</b></u></h2>
        <p>
            Python is another language which has gained a lot of popularity in recent year. While it's not exactly new and has passed the test of time, it's probably the most versatile programming language at the moment.
            You can use Python for web development, Data Science, Scripting, and Automation. Similar to JavaScript, Python also enjoys huge community support and has a lot of useful frameworks, libraries, and tools that can help you create a web application in a quick time.
            For example, you can use Django to create full-stack web applications. If you want more control, you can also use Flask, a minimalist web development framework.
        </p>
        <h2><u><b>TYPESCRIPT</b></u></h2>
        <p>
            TypeScript is my personal favorite and a modern programming language for web development. Just like we have C and C++, TypeScript can be considered as JavaScript++ though it’s not as popular as C++.
            The good part of TypeScript is that it adds type-safety in JavaScript code which means you can catch nasty JavaScript type-related errors in the development phase.
        </p>
        <h2><u><b>PHP</b></u></h2>
        <p>
            I may get a lot of flaks for including PHP in this list of best programming languages for web development in 2022 but to be honest, PHP is one of the best programming languages when it comes to creating web applications.
            It’s a dynamic, server-side scripting language that makes it really easy to create fully functional web applications. If that’s not enough, half of the internet is running on PHP’s shoulder, remember WordPress, the most popular web application software is made on PHP.
        </p>
        <h2><u><b>RUBY</b></u></h2>
        <p>
            Ruby is another programming language that is really great for web development. Similar to PHP and Python, Ruby is also easy to learn and goo for beginners.
            What makes Ruby special for web development is the Ruby on Rails framework which powers websites like Github, Shopify, Airbnb, Groupon, GoodReads, and Kickstarter.
            If you don’t know, Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interfacing
        </p>
        <h2><u><b>HTML & CSS</b></u></h2>
        <p>
            While HTML and CSS are not really programming languages (well, some of you may not agree but yes, they are not the programming language) but they are the backbone for web development and every web developer must learn them.
HTML provides the structure while CSS provides the style and helps them to look better and more visually appealing. If you want to become a serious frontend developer then you must master these two in 2022.
The good thing about them is that you can easily master them in a few weeks and they are relatively easier to learn as well.
